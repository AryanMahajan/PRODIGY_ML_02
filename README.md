Title: K-Means Clustering for Customer Segmentation

Description:

This Python script performs K-Means clustering on a customer dataset to identify groups with similar annual income and spending scores. It's designed to provide insights into potential customer segments for marketing or business strategy purposes.

Prerequisites: Ensure you have Python (version 3.x recommended) and the following libraries installed:
  1. pandas
  2. matplotlib
  3. seaborn
  4. scikit-learn

Usage:

  1. Place Your Data:
    Make sure the CSV file containing your customer data (named "Mall_Customers.csv" by default) is located in the content folder within the repository.
    If your data file has a different name or location, modify the path in the pd.read_csv line within the script.
    
  2. Run the Script:
    Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the cloned repository.
    
  3. Execute the Python script:
    "python main.py"
    This will generate two output PNG image files ("outputs/Figure_1.png" and "outputs/Figure_2.png") that visualize the elbow graph and customer clusters, respectively.
